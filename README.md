# NumericalMethodsForEngineers_MATLAB
All the codes written while partaking in [the online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/numerical-methods-engineers) offered by Coursera, that I finished on 7th April 2021.
A big thank you to Prof. Jeff Chasnov for making the course publically available.

The code was written in MATLAB, compiled and run using MATLAB Online that was made available during the course. I saved the codes in .txt files to have them in my local repository after the course ended.
